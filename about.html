          I was born in Galveston, TX and grew up in Arlington, TX where I
          graduated high school. I went to Texas A&M and graduated with a degree
          in Information and Operations Management. I was hired directly out of
          college as the "IT guy" for a cancer research center. The job mostly
          required me to make sure the cancer center's Macintosh based network
          played nice with the hospital's Windows based network.

          I decided to follow a passion of mine and started a job as a cook in
          College Station. 2 years later I moved to Austin for culinary school
          and have been here ever since. I have had a fortunate career in the
          Austin restaurant scene, having worked at several restaurants
          considered to be among the best in Austin.

          I have worked as a chef for the past 20 years and currently working
          towards another career change. I took the leap a couple of months ago
          and am now studying software development at the Austin Coding Academy.
