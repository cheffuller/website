          I was born in Galveston, TX and grew up in Arlington, TX where I
          graduated high school. I went to Texas A&M and graduated with a degree
          in Information and Operations Management. I was hired directly out of
          college as the "IT guy" for a cancer research center. The job mostly
          required me to make sure the cancer center's Macintosh based network
          played nice with the hospital's Windows based network.

          I started a job as a cook in College Station after doing some soul
          searching about what profession I would be happy working in. 2 years
          later I moved to Austin for culinary school and have been here ever
          since. I have had a fortunate career in restaurants, having worked at
          several restaurants considered to be among the best in Austin.

          I have worked in restaurants for the past 20 years and am currently
          working towards another career change which is why I am enrolling in
          the Austin Coding Academy.
